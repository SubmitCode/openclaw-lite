# SKILL.md — End of Day Reconciliation

**Trigger:** "end of day" / "wrap up" / "reconcile" / "close out"

**Purpose:** Close open loops, update all state files, set up tomorrow.

---

## Instructions

1. **Ask:** "What happened today? Any decisions, completions, or new items?"
   - Accept a brain dump — you'll sort it

2. **Process the brain dump:**
   - New items → add to `INBOX.md` (or directly to relevant project)
   - Decisions made → add to `DECISIONS.md`
   - Things waiting → add to `WAITING_FOR.md`
   - Completed items → update project files, cross off in INDEX.md

3. **Update state files:**
   - `INBOX.md` — remove processed items, add any new ones
   - `WAITING_FOR.md` — mark resolved, add new
   - `projects/INDEX.md` — update statuses
   - Individual project files — append meeting notes or status changes

4. **Write today's memory:**
   - Log key events, decisions, and context to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

5. **Set up tomorrow:**
   - Identify the 1-3 most important things for tomorrow
   - Note any meetings to prep for

6. **Close with:**
   ```
   ## Today's wrap-up
   ✅ [Things completed]
   📝 [Decisions logged]
   ⏳ [New waiting items]
   🔜 Tomorrow's focus: [1-3 things]
   ```

## Notes
- This is the most important ritual — don't skip it when things get busy
- Even a 5-minute version beats nothing
