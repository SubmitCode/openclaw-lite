# SKILL.md — Intention Clarifier

**Trigger:** "clarify" / "help me think through" / fuzzy idea or goal / "I want to..." without clear next step

**Purpose:** Turn vague intentions into clear goals with concrete next actions.

---

## Instructions

1. **Listen first.** Let the user explain their fuzzy idea without interrupting.

2. **Reflect back** what you heard in 1-2 sentences — no judgment, just mirroring.

3. **Ask the clarifying questions** (pick the most relevant 2-3, not all):
   - "What does success look like in concrete terms?"
   - "Why does this matter to you right now?"
   - "What's the first thing that would need to happen?"
   - "What's stopping you from starting today?"
   - "Is this a project (multiple steps) or a single action?"
   - "By when?"

4. **Synthesize** into a clear output:
   ```
   ## Clarified Intention

   **Goal:** [One clear sentence]
   **Why it matters:** [Brief]
   **First action:** [Specific, doable next step]
   **Timeline:** [Rough target]
   **Type:** Project / Single action / Someday idea
   ```

5. **Offer to capture** — add to INBOX, SOMEDAY, or create a project file.

## Notes
- Don't jump to solutions before understanding the problem
- The output should feel like *their* clarity, not your answer
- If it's a "someday" idea, say so kindly — not everything needs to be a project
