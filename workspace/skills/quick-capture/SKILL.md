# SKILL.md — Quick Capture

**Trigger:** "capture" / "add to inbox" / "note this" / "remember" / "log this"

**Purpose:** Fast, frictionless capture without breaking flow. Sort later.

---

## Instructions

1. Take the input exactly as given — don't over-process it
2. Add to `INBOX.md` under the appropriate priority section:
   - 🔴 High — if clearly urgent
   - 🟡 Medium — default
   - ⚪ Low — if explicitly low priority or vague

3. Format:
   ```
   - [Item as stated] — *captured YYYY-MM-DD*
   ```

4. Confirm with a one-liner: `"Added to inbox: [item]"`

5. **Don't ask follow-up questions** unless the item is completely ambiguous — the point is speed.

## Notes
- If the user says "remember this" or "don't forget" → also log to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If it's clearly a decision → also log to `DECISIONS.md`
- If it's clearly "waiting on someone" → also log to `WAITING_FOR.md`
