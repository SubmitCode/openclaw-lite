# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

> This is the agent's curated long-term memory. It's distilled from daily notes and updated periodically.
> Think of daily notes as a journal; this is the mental model — the stuff worth keeping.

## About Me (the User)

_Filled in over time as the agent learns about you._

## Key Decisions

_Decisions made and the reasoning behind them — so you don't relitigate them._

## Ongoing Projects

_What's in flight, current status, what matters._

## Lessons Learned

_Things that went wrong, things that went right, patterns worth remembering._

## Preferences & Quirks

_How the user likes things done — writing style, communication preferences, workflow preferences._

## People & Context

_Key people, teams, relationships — enough context to be useful._
